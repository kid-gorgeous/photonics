    "## Chapter 1: Generalized Argument Principle and Rouché's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter concerns the generalization to operator-valued unctions of two classical results in complex analysis, the argument principle, and Rouché theorem. \n",
    "\n",
    "An efficient method of *complex analysis* to be used is refered to as the Muller's method. It is used to find zeros of a function defined on the complex plane. It is used to compute poles of integral operators, and for the comutatition of resonant cavities, band gap structures, and plasmonic resonances in nanoparticales.\n",

    "    - Holomorphic: is a complex-valued function of one or more complex variables that is complex differentiable n a neighbourhood of each point in a domain in complex coordinate space $\\mathbb{C}^{n}$.\n",
    "    - Meromorphic: is a complex-valued function that is holomorphic on all of $D \\in U$ except for a set of isolated points, which are considered the poles of the function.\n",

    "To understand the *Argument Principle*, $f$ must first be observed as a holomorphic function. It must a zero of order $n$ and at $z_{0}$, such that the function $f(z)$ can be written as $f(z) = (z - z_{0})^{n}g(z)$, where $g$ must be a holomorphic function and nowhere near vanishing in a neighborhood of $z_{0}$. Therefore the ratio: <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "Then the functional ratio of $f'/f$ has a simple pole with residue $n$ at $z_{0}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A similar fact also holds if $f$ has a pole of order $n$ at $z_{0}$, such that $f(z) = (z - z_{0})^{-n}h(z)$, where $h$ must be a holomorphic function and nowhere near vanishing in a neighborhood of $z_{0}$. Therefore the ratio: <br>\n",

    "> $\\frac{f'}{f} = -\\frac{n}{z - z_{0}} + \\frac{h'(z)}{h(z)}$ (which appears as its inverse)\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if $f$ is meromorphic, the function $f'/f$ will have simple poles at the zeros and poles of $f$, and the residue is simply the order of the zero of $f$ or the negative f the order of the pole of $f$. \n",
    "\n",
    "***Theorem 1.1* (Argument Principle)**: *Let $V \\subset \\mathbb{C}$ be a bounded smooth boundary $\\delta$V positively oriented and let $f(z)$ be a meromorphic function in a neightborhood of $\\bar{V}$. Let P and N be the numbers of poles an zeros of $f$ in V, counted with their orders. If $f$ has no poles or zeros on $\\delta$V, then:*\n",
